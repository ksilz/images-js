## What's This?

This project demonstrates how to block image downloads with Selenium in Java. That's both for a locally launched Chrome instance and a remote Bright Data Scraping Browser instance.

## How Does It Work?

You need NodeJS (tested withe the current LTS 20.11.0) and the Google Chrome browser installed.

You start it in a terminal with `node index.js`. By default, that will launch the English wikipedia page in a **local** Chrome instance, with images blocked.
